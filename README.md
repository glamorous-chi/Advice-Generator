### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

I will love to improve the design so that the width and height of the main div is not affected by the size of the texts (i.e the advice coming from the API)

## Acknowledgments

This is my first challenge for the Tech Studio Academy June 2024 Internship. This challenge was a good way to start the internship. Hoping that whatever challenges we will be given in the future will only help us improve our skills and become more experienced developers.
Thanks to the Internship Team for this challenge.
